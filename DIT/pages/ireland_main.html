 <div id = "subtitle">Places to Go & Things to See</div>
 <div id = "body_ie"><p>There are many beautiful attractions in Ireland for hikers and travellers alike. 
The West Coast, Galway and Clare especially, have hillwalks and 
hikes that guide you along some of the rural sites to see. Views from the coast of the 
sea and fields of green are only some of the sites you will see.
The Cliffs of Moher, Co. Clare, are a definite must see.

On the East coast, Co. Wicklow is number one 
on the list. Hailed as the 'Garden of Ireland' Wicklow is a popular destination for 
any sight-seer. Here Glendalough can be found, a beautiful open 
park with picturesque sights and trails for all levels of walker.
Mount Usher Gardens, Ashford is another recommendation in the locality. Aside from the 
exotic gardens there is also an excellent restaurant and cafe. 
If sightseeing is not your thing, there are several other attractions for all ages.
Dublin Zoo, one of the largest in Europe, is located just outside the city centre in 
Phoenix Park. The park itself is also worth a visit, the largest of its kind in Ireland 
and a perfect escape from the bustle of the city.

Dublin city centre is a hive of activity for shoppers and tourists alike, 
its impossible not to spend hours on O'Connell street trawling the shops. 
Dundrum Shopping centre is a 10 minute Luas ride away and is 
one of the best shopping centres in Ireland. 
If shopping is the main highlight of your trip, Dublin is the only 
place to be!</p>
