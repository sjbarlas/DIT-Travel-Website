<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress was surrounded by a deep moat which, in times of war or social unrest, could easily be 
filled with water from a nearby mountain brook. 
A bridge over the moat provided the only access point. The fortress boasts three floors and five towers.
Throughout the years, Fagaras Fortress functioned mainly as a residence for various princes and their families. 
Transylvanian Prince Gabriel Bethlen (1613-1629), strongly influenced by the Italian Renaissance, brought architects and glassmakers from Italy who rebuilt the fortress, 
bestowing elegance and beauty to the construction. During the rule of Georg R&aacute;k&oacute;czi (1630-1649), the castle's fortifications were doubled and the moat was enlarged. 
R&aacute;ck&oacute;zi had the bastions bridged and covered, the moat paved with stones, the bridge and the casemates repaired and a guardhouse built. 
In 1948, Fagaras Fortress was taken over by the communists and functioned as a political prison until it was turned into a museum.
Records show that the interior must have been luxurious in the 17th century; unfortunately, little of its former grandeur has been preserved. 
The castle was deprived of its decorations and fancy furniture when it was turned into a military garrison in the 18th century. 
Today, the beautifully preserved fortress houses the Fagaras County Museum, displaying Roman artifacts, a collection of medieval weapons and 
traditional folk crafts. The museum also hosts a beautiful collection of icons painted on glass.
