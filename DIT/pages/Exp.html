<p>AlKasfah Spring</br>
</div>
<div id=text1 >
<p style= "font-size:14px;">AlKasfah Spring is located in Wilayt ArRustaq in Al Batinah South Governorate. 
It is a collection of natural water springs whose temperatures reach up to 45 degrees Celsius. 
Hot water pours out of it in several streams to irrigate orchards.
 AlKasfah Spring is famous for its sulphate therapeutic waters.
What distinguishes AlKasfah Spring from the rest of the springs in the Sultanate is the presence of sulphur and swimming pools for bathing. The pools are open all year round. Also, 
this spring waters the district’s farms through AlHammam Falaj.</p>

<p> Jabal Shams (Sun Mountain)</p>
</div>
<div id=text3 >
<p style= "font-size:14px;">This is the highest peak in the Arabian Peninsula, rising to an altitude of 3,004 metres above sea level, 
and has a number of versants (slopes) and summits. Every time a tourist reaches a versant, he’ll find that it leads him to another, until he reaches the mountain peak.
Life on the summit is different from what most people are used to, as the weather is mild in summer and cold in winter. Close to the peak lies a deep chasm called the "An Nakhr Balcony",
 one of the most beautiful places tourists visit. It is a deep ravine in the heart of the rocks that can be viewed from the top, which directly overlooks the ravine.
  At the bottom of the ravine rock formations chiselled into different forms by erosion lie at breathtaking depth.
Tourist guest houses have been built where the visitor can spend time enjoying the serenity of this scenic mountain
Jabal Shams is so called because it is the first place to greet sunlight at dawn and the last to say farewell at dusk.</p>

<h1> Salalah</h1>
</div>
<div id=text4 >
<p style= "font-size:14px;">is the capital city of Oman's southern Zufar and Dhofar region. It is often considered to be the "second city" of the Sultanate, 
although some of this designation is probably due to its distinction as Sultan Qaboos' birthplace.
The region is famous for its khareef (monsoon), and the Khareef Festival is an annual event here. 
Many locals will in fact be quite surprised to see non-Arab visitors at other times of year.
</br></br>
Salalah and Dhofar are historically famous for the frankincense trade. 
The region has tended to be rather independent over history, although this has changed since Qaboos' ascention to the throne. 
The Jibbali (Arabic: those of the mountains) tribes maintain a slightly distrustful stance to the government in Muscat, 
although this is more a stance of custom than anything else. 
Interestingly, the tribes speak a different language to the Arabic spoken throughout the Peninsula, 
although visitors are unlikely to encounter it.
<h3>Get in</h3>
<h4>By plane</h4>
Oman Air flies from Muscat to Salalah at least three times a day. The flight takes roughly 90 minutes. The same carrier flies from Dubai to Salalah, with the flight taking some 2 hours scheduled on Wednesdays and Fridays.There are direct flights to Indian cities of Kozhikode & Kochi, and Thiruvananthapuram via Kochi. Air Arabia flies twice a week to Sharjah on Thursdays and Saturdays. Flydubai operates three flights every week from Dubai on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Qatar Air also has a direct flight from Doha to Salalah.
Beware, the taxi from the airport is 10 or 20 times the normal taxi rate.
<h4>By car</h4>
</br>
It is possible to drive from Muscat to Salalah. The trip takes roughly 12 hours (although there are numerous places worth a detour en route). From the starting point sure its a cheerful trip where you can enjoy the wild beauty. Rusayl, Nizwa, Haima, Thumrait and next is the most beautiful Salalah.
Watch out for renegade dunes on the way! When you get hungry, thirsty or tired, you should take the next opportunity to stop - there might not be another one for dozens of miles.
Driving to Salalah from Muscat can either be an amazing and memorable experience, or a very uncomfortable one depending on what kind of traveler you are. The first 5 hours will be very scenic, as you pass Nizwa and other towns. However, it's barren desert and oil fields for most of the remainder of the trip. Travelling at night is usually better than driving in the heat of day (arriving in Salalah at night is a must - the city lights from the high-altitude entry point is gorgeous). There are several stops along the way for food, drinks, a cigarette break, or nature calls.
By bus[edit]
</br></br>
There are daily buses between all Omani cities, very cheap compared to the cost of taxis, airfare, etc. In August 2011 Muscat-Salalah was 6 R.O. (and 11 R.O. for two way ticket)--it's a 12 hour trip. There is also bus service to and from Dubai.
<h4>By boat</h4>
</br>
There is at least one operator in Muscat that will charter you to Salalah.
