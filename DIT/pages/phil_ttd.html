<h2 class="subtitle"> <b> 2. Explore and start an adventure </b> </h2>

Over the past two decades, the Philippines has gained considerable international tourism attention for its beaches and scuba diving spots. However, the majority of 
the country's most awe-inspiring treasures are still way off the beaten tourist track. While it is definitely worth visiting its most famous beaches and 
experiencing the glory of its established dive sites, it is away from four-star hotels and beach-side bars where one finds the Philippines' true wonders. 
In these little-known places, coastlines of sheer rock display countless cascades that tumble into the ocean. Extensive cave systems contain bizarre 
landscapes that are as close as one can get to setting foot on an alien planet. Mountains covered by old-growth rainforests teem with life and harbor 
indigenous communities that have retained their traditions since pre-Hispanic times. And, not surprisingly, some of the most spectacularly pristine beaches 
and marine ecosystems on Earth remain unknown to all but a few. What's amazing is that many of these gems are not too far away from the main tourist digs and 
urban areas. Most are remote not in terms of actual distance but in terms of awareness.

Their trips are designed to showcase the best of an area and not just a single place, each of their journeys is a series of destinations. 
On an Uncharted Philippines adventure, the distinction between getting there and being there is often blurred and everything is simply remembered as one 
unbelievable experience.
<br> <br>
Be Warned: most of their destinations cannot be accessed without sweat. All of their trips involve hiking, and on some, you will need to carry overnight or even 
multi-day supplies on your back.

everything that you will need - from designer western brands to items specifically designed for the tourist market. Around the country, specifically in city

world Mall of Asia, Robinson Place, Balikbayan Handicrafts, Tutuban Center Mall and at the San Andres Market (for fresh fruits and other produce). In Makati 
and its surrounding areas, shop at Greenbelt, Glorietta, Landmark Department Store, Greenhills Shopping Center, Megamall, Shangri-La Mall and at Tiendecitas.
