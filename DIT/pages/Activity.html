<h1>Activities</h1>
<div id = "new">Rock Climbing</div>
</div>
<div id=text1 >
<p style= "font-size:13px;">Much of the climbing in Oman was deepwater soloing ascending seaside cliffs without a rope a relatively new form of the sport that Synnott describes in an interview this week with contributing writer Peter Miller.
</br></br>
What is deepwater soloing?
</br></br>
Deepwater soloing is basically free soloing, but you're doing it above water. Free soloing is rock climbing without a rope. A lot of non-climbers confuse it with free climbing. Free climbing is climbing a rock with your hands and feet,
 but you have a rope for protection in case you fall. When you free solo, falling is not an option.
But with deepwater soloing, you can safely fall.
Exactly. You can fall from heights where you could never fall over the ground. If you were to fall 30 feet and hit the ground, you could be dead. But if you fell 30 feet into water, 
you're pretty much fine.
</br></br>
What made Oman a good place for deepwater soloing?
</br></br>
We estimated there was something like 100 to 150 miles of coastline on the Musandam Peninsula that were essentially all cliffs coming out of the ocean. That's a lot.
 You can put in ten new routes in a span of 50 feet. 
Think about 100 miles of that, how many new climbs there could be.</p>

<p style= "font-size:13px;">
Oman is one of the most popular diving destinations in the region.
 It has an exceptionally diverse marine life and a number of marine cliffs, small islands, bays and caves, as well as a diverse and unique marine life and coral reefs. The best months for diving in Oman are the period from April to July, 
but diving can be enjoyed at all times.
</br></br>
The most prominent diving areas around the capital Muscat are: Al Khayran, Al Fahil Island, Dimaniyat Islands, Al Makbara Bay (Old Muscat), in addition to Al Jissah Beach. Each of the above mentioned locations contains not less than 11 different diving sites, each with a diverse environment.

<h1>Desert Activities</h1>
</div>
<div id=text3 >
<p style= "font-size:13px;">
Deserts differ in their nature and quality of sands, varying from the very soft to the very coarse and dense. This factor constitutes a challenge with regard to desert activities. One of these is called The Badiya Challenge Race. It is given this name due to the extremely soft sand that sinks under your feet as you cross it. 
The race involves climbing sand dunes from a low area to the top in the shortest possible time, filling participants with a thrilling excitement. Usually these dune races are accompanied by a number of popular and traditional events.
</br></br>
Just as each natural environment has its own beauty and charm, so the desert has its own simple atmosphere and style that are extremely divergent from city life. The desert awaits you with a number of activities, such as cycling with four-wheel drive bicycles,
 skiing on sand, sand dunning with four-wheel buggies, in addition to the fun of camping under the star-studded desert sky.

<h1>Camping</h1>
</div>
<div id=text4 >
<p style= "font-size:13px;">
Many people like to take a break away from the hustle and bustle of city life with its pampered lifestyle and go camping to break the routine of their lives.
 The diverse environment of Oman allows many options when it comes to camping. Camping is enjoyed on Shatti Qantab in Muscat Governorate, Shatti Ras Al Hadd in A'Sharqiyah South Governorate, on mountain tops in Jabal Shams (Sun Mountain) or Al Jabal Al Akhdar (Green Mountain) in A'Dakhiliyah Governorate, camping in the desert, both in Badiya sands in A'Sharqiyah North Governorate, or in The Empty Quarter in Dhofar.  This is not to mention the magnificence of camping in Dimaniyat Islands in Al Batinah South Governorate, or camping in one of the secluded beaches that spread in Musandam Governorate. Oman is sure to provide versatile options for fans of this outdoor activity.
</br></br>
In addition to the camps created for tourists in each of these areas, visitors are allowed to pitch their own tents in each of these places, as well as in many others.</p>

<h1>Camel Racing</h1>
</div>
<div id=text5 >
<p style= "font-size:13px;">
This is a popular sport where camels compete at speeds of up to 64 kilometres per hour on tracks specially built for this kind of race. Races take place regularly.
</br></br>

Camels, the "ships of the desert," have played a vital role in the region over thousands of years. Camels have impacted all aspects of daily desert life. Besides being a means of travel,
 food and shelter, camels are also used for entertaining, celebrating and competing in festivals and special events.
</br></br>

The sport is greatly similar to horse racing. Camel racing is an authentic Arab sport, famous especially among the Arabian Peninsula Arabs. 
Camel racing has evolved into an official and professional race that includes race tracks, specialised farms for raising camels and running intensive training programmes, 
as well as using new technologies.</p>

<h1>Mutrah Souq</h1>
</div>
<div id=text6  >
<p style= "font-size:13px;">
Every place has its distinctive flavour and every city has a market that relates its stories, embraces its history and accompanies its evolution. If you enjoy visiting public markets, 
you must see Mutrah Souq, the most beautiful market your eyes will ever see!
</br></br>
Mutrah Souq is one of the oldest markets in Oman, dating back about two hundred years. Its antiquity has perhaps increased the extent of its beauty, magic and allure.
</br></br>
You cannot see Mutrah Souq from the outside, as it stretched deep within the city. The market starts at a gate facing the Sea of Oman and Mutrah Corniche, 
and ends with another gate in the city’s old quarters that usually receive the majority of visitors coming from other Omani towns and villages.
</br></br>
Mutrah Souq is a prototype of old Eastern markets, characterised by narrow winding alleys roofed with wood. This Souq goes by another name among the Omanis: the Market of Darkness,
 due to its myriad of alleys and roads lined by shops that block the sun during the day. This name applies specifically to the section that extends from the Prophet's Mosque to Khawr Bimbah. 
 And as if two names were not enough for this souq, the east and west parts of Mutrah Souq, separated by Khawr Bimbah, are also known as “the small market” and “the large market”. 
The Market of Darkness is the small market, whereas the large market is the wholesale market.</p>
