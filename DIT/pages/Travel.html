Narrow Gauge Train Trips in Maramures - Romania
</div>
<div id="paragraph">
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow-gauge railway and the steam powered locomotives (Mocanita) in Viseu de Sus are one of the most
remarkable railway heritage attractions in Romania and in Eastern Europe. It is the only remaining, working
narrow gauge forestry railway of many that were constructed(1932) to transport timber from the vast,
remote forests of the Carpathian Mountains and their foothills.
Starting from Viseu de Sus - a small logging town in Maramures - the railway climbs the beautiful roadless Vaser valley for 31 miles, 
deep into the forests of the Maramures mountains to the tiny hamlet of Coman. Today, four steam-powered locomotives(the oldest one was built in 1910) are transporting logs, down, and<br>lumberjacks and visitors up and down the valley.
The train is the only access to settlements up the valley, other than on foot.During the relaxing journey, travelers can enjoy
the views of woodland and rushing rivers.
After a picnic and / or a walk in the forest while the train is loaded at the terminus travelers will return to Viseu de Sus.
On the trip back in the afternoon, the engine driver whistles for brakemen to stop the train - sometimes for passengers, or even to pick mushrooms.
The local people are friendly with fascinating stories to tell. 
In short, this is a remarkable survival from an earlier age, well worth a visit, and one that will benefit from more tourist traffic in its efforts to survive in this fast modern age.<br><br>
<h2>Romanian Traditional Foods</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romania has had influence from both invaders and neighbors where its traditional cuisine is concerned. 
<br>Romania's traditional food sees touches of Turkish, Hungarian, Austrian, and other cuisines, but over the years, these dishes have become just as traditional as the oldest Romanian traditional foods.
Romanian traditional foods heavily feature meat.Cabbage rolls, sausages, and stews (like tocanita) are popular main dishes. Muschi poiana consists of mushroom- and bacon-stuffed beef in a puree of vegetables and tomato sauce. 
<br>You can also sample traditional Romanian fish dishes, like the salty,<br>grilled carp called saramura.
Soups - made with or without meat, or made with fish - are usually offered on menus at Romanian restaurants.
Zama is a green bean soup with chicken, parsley, and dill. 
You may also encounter rice and moussaka, vegetables prepared in various ways (including stuffed peppers), and hearty casseroles.
<br>Traditional Romanian desserts may resemble baklava.Other pastries may best be described as danishes(pastries with cheese filling). 
Crepes with various fillings and toppings may also be on the typical Romanian dessert menu.
