Nestled at the foot of the Bucegi<br> Mountains in the picturesque town of Sinaia<br>, Peles Castle is a masterpiece of German<br> new-Renaissance architecture, considered by<br> many one of the most stunning castles in<br> Europe. 
Commissioned by King Carol I in 1873<br> and completed in 1883, the castle served as<br> the summer residence of the royal family<br> until 1947. 
 Its 160 rooms are adorned with<br> the finest examples of European art, Murano<br> crystal chandeliers, German stained glass<br> windows and Cordoba leather-covered walls.<br>
Peles Castle was the first European castle<br> entirely lit by electrical current. The<br> electricity was produced by the castle's own<br> plant. 
 The castle draws its name from neighboring Peles Creek, which passes<br> right through the courtyard. <br>
The first movie projection in Romania took place in<br> 1906 in the castle's Theater Hall.
The furniture in the Music Room is<br> carved of teak, a gift to King Carol I from the Maharajah of <br>Kapurtala in India, while handmade silk embroideries adorn the ceiling<br> and walls of the Turkish Salon.
The ceiling paintings and decorative<br> frescoes in the Theater Hall were designed by the renowned Austrian<br> artists Gustav Klimt and Frantz Matsch. Over 4,000 European and <br>Oriental pieces dating from the 15th to the 19th centuries are on<br> display in the armories. 
King Ferdinand, who succeeded Carol I, <br>commissioned the smaller, art nouveau-style Pelisor Castle nearby. <br>
Pelisor's 70 rooms feature a unique collection of turn-of-the 
century Viennese furniture and Tiffany and <br>Lalique glassware. 
Also worth exploring in town is Sinaia Monastery, founded by Prince Mihai Cantacuzino<br> in 1695, and named after the great Sinai Monastery on Mount Sinai. 
The monastery served as the residence<br> of the royal family until Peles Castle was built, and now is home to a monastic establishment.
Sinaia, <br>a well-known ski resort, and the surrounding towns of Busteni, Azuga and Predeal provide many <br>facilities for an active vacation - from ski and hiking trails to wildlife viewing.
