&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasnov Fortress,is located on a rocky<br> hilltop in the Carpathian Mountains, 650<br> ft. above
the town of Rasnov. First<br> mentioned in an official document in 1331,<br> the fortress was built by Teutonic Knights<br> as
protection against invading Tartars and <br>was later enlarged by the local Saxon<br> population.<br>
Strategically located on the commercial <br>route linking the provinces of Transylvania <br>and Walachia,<br>  
Rasnov differs from other Saxon fortresses <br>in that it was designed as a place of <br>refuge over extended
periods of time. As such, it had at least 30 houses,<br>a school, a chapel and other buildings more<br>commonly associated with a village.<br>
The defensive system included nine towers, two<br>bastions and a drawbridge. Surrounded by<br>500-foot-slopes
on the north, south and west sides,<br>the fortress was obliged to surrender only once,<br>in the year 1612 
when invaders managed to find the<br>secret route that supplied the people inside the<br>
fortress with water. With the location of their water<br>supply no longer a secret, the need for a well inside the fortress became a must.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to local legend, two Turkish prisoners were put to the task of digging a well<br>
through solid rock in the center of the fortress. They were promised their freedom once<br>the well was finished. 

Work on the 470-foot-deep well began in 1623 and took 17 years to<br>complete. 
The well provided extra security as it meant the people didn't have to go<br>outside the gates at 
all during a siege. It was in use until 1850 when the wheel broke.<br>
The last siege of Rasnov Fortress took place in 1690 during the final Ottoman invasion<br>of Transylvania.
Damaged by fire in 1718, it was rebuilt the following year. The next<br>major damage occurred as the result of an earthquake in 1802. 
The fortress was last used<br>as a place of refuge during the revolution of 1848 and was abandoned after that.
Recently,<br>the old fortress has been restored to its former glory and today, you can visit the<br>impressive remains. 
There is also a museum here, hidden behind the ancient walls, where you can find a<br> skeleton buried beneath a glass floor, as well as some other interesting artifacts. 
The inner rooms<br> are maze-like, with several wooden ladders linking them and a few so-called secret passages which <br>should keep you busy for quite awhile.
